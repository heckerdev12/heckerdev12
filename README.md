## Improved Statistics Cards

Due to issues with the previous stats card provider, we now recommend using the following reliable alternatives:

- [GitHub Stats Card](https://github.com/ghs-sh/github-stats-card) - A customizable, user-friendly stats card generator.
- [Shields.io](https://shields.io/) - Create customizable badges for various stats including GitHub metrics.
- [GitHub Readme Stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats) - A GitHub repository that provides a customizable readme stats card.

### Example Usage:

```markdown
![Anurag's GitHub Stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=anuraghazra&show_icons=true)
![Top Languages](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=anuraghazra&layout=compact)
```

### How to Implement
Replace any previous markdown for GitHub stats in your README with the new links provided above. Be sure to customize the username in the links to match your GitHub account.
